## The Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Design Principles
* Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
