# The Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

# The Abstract Factory Pattern
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Design Principles
* Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
