# The Command Pattern
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parmeterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

# The Meta Command Pattern
Allows you to create macros of commands so that you can execute multiple commands at once.

# The Null Object Pattern
Removes the responsbility for handling 'null' from the client when you don't have a meaningful object to return.
